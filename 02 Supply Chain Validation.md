# Supplychain Validation
This section demonstrates how to power on the Passport and execute the supply chain validation. There is a private key stored on the secure element used for this validation. By scanning a static public key QR code with the Passport, it will generate 4-words which are used as a cecksum that only a valid Passport private key can produce. 

Hold down the button in the lower left-hand corner of the Passport. After initial boot, you will be greated with a welcome message. You can scroll to the bottom of that message by holding the <kbd>down arrow</kbd> then press the <kbd>continue</kbd> button.
