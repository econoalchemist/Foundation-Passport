# Additional Features
This sections covers a few additional features at a high level. This is meant more a reference material than step by step instructions.

### Change the screen brightness
Purpose: Helps save on battery life, easier to view the screen in low light environments. 
Process: `Settings` > `Screen Brightness` > choose `25%`, `50%`, `75%`, or `100%`

### Auto shutdown
Purpose: Helps save on battery life, added security if you step away from the device for too long.
Process: `Settings` > `Auto Shutdown` > choose `1 minute`, `2 minutes`, `5 minutes`, `15 minutes`, `30 minutes`, `60 minutes`, or `Never`.

### Change PIN
Purpose: Allows user to modify the existing PIN number in case it was compromised or for any other reason.
Process: `Settings` > `Advanced` > `Change PIN` > enter your current PIN, then add and confirm your new PIN. This action will generate two new anti-phishing words, so be sure to note that in your backup information. 

### Units
Purpose: Change the way bitcoin amounts are displayed on the device.
Process: `Settings` > `Advanced` > `Units` > choose `BTC` or `sats`. For example, 1.2575 BTC would be displayed as 125,750,000 sats.

### Sign a text file
Purpose: Prove ownership of an address. 
Process: `Settings` > `Advanced` > `Sign Text File` > then load your message in a `.txt` file and save it to the microSD card. Insert the microSD card, select the file, and sign. The Passport will automatically select the address used to sign and save a new file appended with `-signed.txt`. 

### Import Public Key
Purpose: This allows advanced users to import their own public key to the Passport so that when they compile thier own firmware, the Passport will use their own key to verify it along with the Foundation developer keys. 
Process: `Settings` > `Advanced` > `Developer PubKey` > `Install PubKey` then insert a microSD card with your public key and import.
