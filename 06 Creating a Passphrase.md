# Creating a Passphrase
A passphrase adds an extra layer of security to your Bitcoin wallet. The passphrase is an additional piece of information that is required in order to access your private key and sign transactions. The passphrase can be thought of as a "25th word" appended to the end of your 24-word seed phrase. Without the passphrase, the bitcoin will not be accessible.

There are some important considerations to make with passphrases:

- With the added security comes added complication. Keep in mind that it may not be you attempting to recover your bitcoin, it may be your loved ones who may not understand how Bitcoin wallets work. 
- The Pasport (or any BIP39 wallet) has no way of knowing whether or not you entered the correct passphrase. Any passphrase entered will cause the wallet to display a fully functioning and valid bitcoin wallet. But only when you enter your passphrase correctly will the right wallet be opened. A "fingerprint" is used to uniquely identify the wallet so you know it is the right one.
- You will now need to secure an extra piece of information for a complete backup. This can a disadvantage if you want to minimize the information required to access your bitcoin or this could be advantageous if you leverage it as a duress feature. 

If you want to add a passphrase to your Passport, this section will show you how to do it. Make sure you write this information down in a notebook and secure it. The passphrase is not stored in your Passport encrypted backup file. 

After you add a passphrase, in order to have a complete backup, you will need:

- The microSD card with the encrypted backup file
- The 6-word password to decrypt it
- The passphrase & fingerprint
