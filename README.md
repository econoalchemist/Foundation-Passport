# Foundation Passport
This guide explains how to get started with a [Passport](https://foundationdevices.com/) cold storage wallet. The passport is a Bitcoin hardware wallet that is assembled in the USA, fully open source, and designed to only be used in a secure air-gapped fashion. Taking self custody of your bitcoin means that you are ultimately responsible for your own wealth, there is no bank vault to protect you or 1-800 help line to reverse a transaction. Being able to transact without permission is powerful, and with great power comes great responsibility. Let's get your journey into self custody started on the right foot.
